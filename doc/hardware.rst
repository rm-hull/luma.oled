Identifying your serial interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can determine if you have an I2C or a SPI interface by counting the number
of pins on your card. An I2C display will have 4 pins while an SPI interface
will have 6 or 7 pins.

If you have a SPI display, check the back of your display for a configuration
such as this:

.. image:: images/serial_config.jpg
   :alt: serial config

For this display, the two 0 Ohm (jumper) resistors have been connected to "0"
and the table shows that "0 0" is 4-wire SPI. That is the type of connection
that is currently supported by the SPI mode of this library.

A list of tested devices can be found in the
`wiki <https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.oled/wiki/Usage-&-Benchmarking>`_.

I2C vs. SPI
^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have not yet purchased your display, you may be wondering if you should
get an I2C or SPI display. The basic trade-off is that I2C will be easier to connect
because it has fewer pins while SPI may have a faster display update rate due
to running at a higher frequency and having less overhead (see
`benchmarks <https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.oled/wiki/Usage-&-Benchmarking>`_).

Tips for connecting the display
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* If you don't want to solder directly on the Pi, get 2.54mm 40 pin female
  single row headers, cut them to length, push them onto the Pi pins, then
  solder wires to the headers.

* If you need to remove existing pins to connect wires, be careful to heat
  each pin thoroughly, or circuit board traces may be broken.

* Triple check your connections. In particular, do not reverse VCC and GND.

Pre-requisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I2C

The P1 header pins should be connected as follows:

========== ====== ============ ======== ==============
OLED Pin   Name   Remarks      RPi Pin  RPi Function
========== ====== ============ ======== ==============
1          GND    Ground       P01-6    GND
2          VCC    +3.3V Power  P01-1    3V3

4          SDA    Data         P01-3    GPIO 2 (SDA)
========== ====== ============ ======== ==============

You can also solder the wires directly to the underside of the RPi GPIO pins.

.. seealso::

  Alternatively, on rev.2 RPi's, right next to the male pins of the P1 header,
  there is a bare P5 header which features I2C channel 0, although this doesn't
  appear to be initially enabled and may be configured for use with the Camera
  module.

Ensure that the I2C kernel driver is enabled::

  $ dmesg | grep i2c
  [    4.925554] bcm2708_i2c 20804000.i2c: BSC1 Controller at 0x20804000 (irq 79) (baudrate 100000)
  [    4.929325] i2c /dev entries driver

or::

  $ lsmod | grep i2c
  i2c_dev                 5769  0
  i2c_bcm2708             4943  0
  regmap_i2c              1661  3 snd_soc_pcm512x,snd_soc_wm8804,snd_soc_core

If you have no kernel modules listed and nothing is showing using ``dmesg``
then this implies the kernel I2C driver is not loaded. Enable the I2C as
follows:

#. Run ``sudo raspi-config``
#. Use the down arrow to select ``5 Interfacing Options``
#. Arrow down to ``P5 I2C``
#. Select **yes** when it asks you to enable I2C
#. Also select **yes** when it asks about automatically loading the kernel module
#. Use the right arrow to select the **<Finish>** button

After rebooting re-check that the ``dmesg | grep i2c`` command shows whether
I2C driver is loaded before proceeding. You can also
`enable I2C manually <http://elinux.org/RPiconfig#Device_Tree>`_ if the
``raspi-config`` utility is not available.

Optionally, to improve performance, increase the I2C baudrate from the default
of 100KHz to 400KHz by altering ``/boot/config.txt`` to include::

  dtparam=i2c_arm=on,i2c_baudrate=400000

Then reboot.

Next, add your user to the *i2c* group and install ``i2c-tools``::

  $ sudo usermod -a -G i2c pi
  $ sudo apt-get install i2c-tools

Logout and in again so that the group membership permissions take effect, and
then check that the device is communicating properly (if using a rev.1 board,
use 0 for the bus, not 1)::

  $ i2cdetect -y 1
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
    00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- UU 3c -- -- --
    40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

According to the man-page, "UU" means that probing was skipped, because the
address was in use by a driver. It suggest that there is a chip at that
address. Indeed the documentation for the device indicates it uses two
addresses.

SPI
"""
The GPIO pins used for this SPI connection are the same for all versions of the
Raspberry Pi, up to and including the Raspberry Pi 3 B.

========== ====== ============ ======== ==============
OLED Pin   Name   Remarks      RPi Pin  RPi Function
========== ====== ============ ======== ==============
1          VCC    +3.3V Power  P01-17   3V3
2          GND    Ground       P01-20   GND
3          D0     Clock        P01-23   GPIO 11 (SCLK)
4          D1     MOSI         P01-19   GPIO 10 (MOSI)
5          RST    Reset        P01-22   GPIO 25
6          DC     Data/Command P01-18   GPIO 24
7          CS     Chip Select  P01-24   GPIO 8 (CE0)
========== ====== ============ ======== ==============

.. note::

  * When using the 4-wire SPI connection, Data/Command is an "out of band" signal
    that tells the controller if you're sending commands or display data. This
    line is not a part of SPI and the library controls it with a separate GPIO
    pin. With 3-wire SPI and I2C, the Data/Command signal is sent "in band".

  * If you're already using the listed GPIO pins for Data/Command and/or Reset,
    you can select other pins and pass a ``bcm_DC`` and/or a ``bcm_RST``
    argument specifying the new *BCM* pin numbers in your serial interface create
    call.

  * The use of the terms 4-wire and 3-wire SPI are a bit confusing because, in
    most SPI documentation, the terms are used to describe the regular 4-wire
    configuration of SPI and a 3-wire mode where the input and output lines, MOSI
    and MISO, have been combined into a single line called SISO. However, in the
    context of these OLED controllers, 4-wire means MOSI + Data/Command and 3-wire
    means Data/Command sent as an extra bit over MOSI.

  * Because CS is connected to CE0, the display is available on SPI port 0. You
    can connect it to CE1 to have it available on port 1. If so, pass
    ``port=1`` in your serial interface create call.

Enable the SPI port::

    $ sudo raspi-config
    > Advanced Options > A6 SPI

If ``raspi-config`` is not available, enabling the SPI port can be done
`manually <http://elinux.org/RPiconfig#Device_Tree>`_.

Ensure that the SPI kernel driver is enabled::

  $ ls -l /dev/spi*
  crw-rw---- 1 root spi 153, 0 Nov 25 08:32 /dev/spidev0.0
  crw-rw---- 1 root spi 153, 1 Nov 25 08:32 /dev/spidev0.1

or::

  $ lsmod | grep spi
  spi_bcm2835             6678  0

Then add your user to the *spi* and *gpio* groups::

  $ sudo usermod -a -G spi,gpio pi

Log out and back in again to ensure that the group permissions are applied
successfully.
