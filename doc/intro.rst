Introduction
------------
Interfacing `OLED matrix displays
<https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.oled/wiki/Usage-&-Benchmarking>`_ with the
SSD1306, SSD1309, SSD1322, SSD1325, SSD1327, SSD1331, SSD1351 or SH1106 driver
in Python 2 or 3 using I2C/SPI on the Raspberry Pi and other linux-based
single-board computers: the library provides a Pillow_-compatible drawing
canvas, and other functionality to support:

* scrolling/panning capability,
* terminal-style printing,
* state management,
* color/greyscale (where supported),
* dithering to monochrome

The SSD1306 display pictured below is 128 x 64 pixels, and the board is `tiny`,
and will fit neatly inside the RPi case.

   Benchmarks for tested devices can be found in the
   `wiki <https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.oled/wiki/Usage-&-Benchmarking>`_.

As well as display drivers for various physical OLED devices there are
emulators that run in real-time (with pygame_) and others that can take
screenshots, or assemble animated GIFs, as per the examples below (source code
for these is available in the `luma.examples <https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.examples>`_
