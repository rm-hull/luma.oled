Python library interfacing OLED matrix displays with the SSD1306, SSD1331 or
SH1106 driver using I2C/SPI on the Raspberry Pi.

Further technical details for the SSD1306 OLED display can be found in the
`datasheet <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm-hull/ssd1306/master/doc/tech-spec/SSD1306.pdf>`_.
See also the datasheet for the
`SH1106 chipset <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm-hull/ssd1306/sh1106-compat/doc/tech-spec/SH1106.pdf>`_.
A list of tested devices can be found in the
`wiki <https://github.com/rm-hull/ssd1306/wiki/Usage-&-Benchmarking>`_.

The SSD1306 display pictured below is 128 x 64 pixels, and the board is `tiny`,
and will fit neatly inside the RPi case (the SH1106 is slightly different, in
that it supports 132 x 64 pixels).

As well as display drivers for SSD1306-, SSD1331- and SH1106-class OLED devices
there are emulators that run in real-time (with pygame) and others that can
take screenshots, or assemble animated GIFs, as per the examples below (source
code for these is available in the `examples <https://github.com/rm-hull/ssd1306/tree/master/examples>`_ directory:
