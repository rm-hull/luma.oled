Python library interfacing OLED matrix displays with the SSD1306, SSD1325, SSD1331 or 
SH1106 driver using I2C/SPI on the Raspberry Pi and other linux-based single-board computers - 
it provides a Pillow-compatible drawing canvas, and other functionality to support:

* scrolling/panning capability,
* terminal-style printing,
* state management,
* color/greyscale (where supported),
* dithering to monochrome

A list of tested devices can be found in the
`wiki <https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.oled/wiki/Usage-&-Benchmarking>`_.

The SSD1306 display pictured below is 128 x 64 pixels, and the board is `tiny`,
and will fit neatly inside the RPi case.

As well as display drivers for various physical OLED devices, there are emulators that run in real-time 
(with pygame) and others that can take screenshots, or assemble animated GIFs, as per the examples below (source
code for these is available in the `examples <https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.oled/tree/master/examples>`_ directory:
