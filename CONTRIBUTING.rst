Pull requests (code changes / documentation / typos / feature requests / setup) are gladly accepted. If you are
intending some large-scale changes, please get in touch first to make sure we're on the same page: try and include
a docstring for any new methods, and try and keep method bodies small, readable and PEP8-compliant.
