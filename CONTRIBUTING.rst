Pull requests (code changes / documentation / typos / feature requests / setup)
are gladly accepted. If you are intending to introduce some large-scale
changes, please get in touch first to make sure we're on the same page: try to
include a docstring for any new method or class, and keep method bodies small,
readable and PEP8-compliant. Add tests and strive to keep the code coverage
levels high.
