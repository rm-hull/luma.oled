Do you know the fonts of the Command & Conquer classics such as C&C: Red Alert?
My plans were to firstly re-create these fonts for a personal use, for my C&C website and later for the C&C community.

Today I want to provide you with these fonts!

My "C&C: Red Alert [LAN] (TrueType)" font is a minifont or also called as a pixelfont.
Pixelfonts are very small but in a way amazingly beautiful looking and fascinating fonts.

These kind of fonts are mostly best by using them in sizes between 8pt and 12pt.
It depends by their developer's thoughts and usage.

I personally commend using my C&C: Red Alert fonts in a size of 10pt!
This size is also the original one which is used within Command & Conquer and C&C: Red Alert.

This "C&C: Red Alert [LAN] (TrueType)" font is that one being used inside the C&C: Red Alert LAN lobby.
Some character additions and updates to my fonts were done as well.

Please notice that a lot of signs, symbols, and special characters are still missing, but will be added in future.
