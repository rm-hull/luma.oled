Do you know the fonts of the Command & Conquer classics such as C&C: Red Alert?
My plans were to firstly re-create these fonts for a personal use, for my C&C website and later for the C&C community.

Today I want to provide you with these fonts!

My "C&C: Red Alert fonts (TrueType)" are minifonts or also called pixelfonts.
Pixelfonts are very small but in a way amazingly beautiful looking and fascinating fonts.

These kind of fonts are mostly best by using them in sizes between 8pt and 12pt.
It depends by their developer's thoughts and usage.

I personally commend using my C&C: Red Alert fonts in a size of 10pt!
This size is also the original one which is used within Command & Conquer and C&C: Red Alert.

These "C&C: Red Alert fonts (TrueType)" are those being used inside the C&C: Red Alert game.
Some character additions and updates to my fonts were done as well.

Please notice that a lot of signs, symbols, and special characters are still missing, but will be added in future.
