# SSD1306 / SH1106 OLED Driver

Interfacing OLED matrix displays with the SSD1306 or SH1106 controller in Python
using I2C or 4-wire SPI on the Raspberry Pi.

These displays are available for a few pounds from eBay. The I2C interface has
been tested with
[this display](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/191279261331)
and the SPI interface has been tested with
[this display](http://www.ebay.com/itm/281648238188)
.

Technical details for the supported OLED displays can be found in the datasheets
for the
[SSD1306](/doc/tech-spec/SSD1306.pdf?raw=true)
and
[SH1106](/doc/tech-spec/SH1106.pdf)
OLED controllers.

These 128x64 pixel OLED displays are tiny and fit neatly inside a transparent
RPi case:

## Identifying your serial interface

You can determine if you have an I2C or a SPI interface by counting the number
of pins on your card. An I2C display will have 4 pins while an SPI interface
will have 6 or 7 pins.

If you have a SPI display, check the back of your display for a configuration
such as this:

![SPI configuration table](/doc/serial_config.jpg?raw=true)

For this display, the two 0 Ohm (jumper) resistors have been connected to "0"
and the table shows that "0 0" is 4-wire SPI. That is the type of connection
that is currently supported by the SPI mode of this library.

3-wire SPI eliminates the separate Data/Command line by sending an extra bit
with each byte, which causes a small amount of overhead. Supporting 3-wire SPI
would be trivial but has not been implemented yet (no devices to test with).

## I2C vs. SPI

If you have not yet purchased your display, you may be wondering if you should
get I2C or SPI. The basic tradeoff is that I2C will be easier to connect because
it has fewer pins while SPI may have a faster display update rate due to running
at a higher frequency and having less overhead.

## Tips for connecting the display

* If you don't want to solder directly on the Pi, get 2.54mm 40 pin female
  single row headers, cut them to length, push them onto the Pi pins, then
  solder wires to the headers.

* If you need to remove existing pins to connect wires, be careful to heat each
  pin thoroughly, or circuit board traces may be broken.
  
* Triple check your connections. In particular, do not reverse VCC and GND.

### Wiring

#### P1 Header

For prototyping, the P1 header pins should be connected as follows:

| Board Pin | Name  | Remarks     | RPi Pin | RPi Function | Colour |
|----------:|:------|:------------|--------:|--------------|--------|
| 1         | GND   | Ground      | P01-6   | GND          | Black  |
| 2         | VCC   | +3.3V Power | P01-1   | 3V3          | White  |
| 3         | SCL   | Clock       | P01-5   | GPIO 3 (SCL) | Purple |
| 4         | SDA   | Data        | P01-3   | GPIO 2 (SDA) | Grey   |

#### P5 Header

On rev.2 RPi's, right next to the male pins of the P1 header, there is a bare P5
header which features I2C channel 0, although this doesn't appear to be
initially enabled and may be configured for use with the Camera module. 

| Board Pin | Name  | Remarks     | RPi Pin | RPi Function  | Colour |
|----------:|:------|:------------|--------:|---------------|--------|
| 1         | GND   | Ground      | P5-07   | GND           | Black  |
| 2         | VCC   | +3.3V Power | P5-02   | 3V3           | White  |
| 3         | SCL   | Clock       | P5-04   | GPIO 29 (SCL) | Purple |
| 4         | SDA   | Data        | P5-03   | GPIO 28 (SDA) | Grey   |

### Pre-requisites

This was tested with Raspian on a rev.2 model B, with a vanilla kernel version
3.12.28+. Ensure that the I2C kernel driver is enabled:

    $ dmesg | grep i2c
    [   19.310456] bcm2708_i2c_init_pinmode(1,2)
    [   19.323643] bcm2708_i2c_init_pinmode(1,3)
    [   19.333772] bcm2708_i2c bcm2708_i2c.1: BSC1 Controller at 0x20804000 (irq 79) (baudrate 100000)
    [   19.501285] i2c /dev entries driver

or

    $ lsmod | grep i2c
    i2c_dev                 5769  0 
    i2c_bcm2708             4943  0 
    regmap_i2c              1661  3 snd_soc_pcm512x,snd_soc_wm8804,snd_soc_core

If you dont see the I2C drivers, alter */etc/modules* and add the following two
lines:

    i2c-bcm2708
    i2c-dev

And alter */etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf* and comment out the line:

   blacklist i2c-bcm2708

Then reboot.

Then add your user to the i2c group:

    $ sudo adduser pi i2c

Install I2C related dependencies:

    $ sudo apt-get install i2c-tools

Next check that the device is communicating properly (if using a rev.1 board,
use 0 for the bus not 1):

    $ i2cdetect -y 1
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
    00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- UU 3c -- -- --
    40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

According to the manual, "UU" means that probing was skipped, because the
address was in use by a driver. It suggest that there is a chip at that address.
Indeed the documentation for the device indicates it uses two addresses.

## SPI

How to connect a 4-wire SPI serial interface display.

### Wiring

The GPIO pins used for this SPI connection are the same for all versions of the
Raspberry Pi, up to and including the Raspberry Pi 2 B.

| OLED Pin  | Name  | Remarks     | RPi Pin | RPi Function |
|----------:|:------|:------------|--------:|--------------|
| 1         | VCC   | +3.3V Power | P01-17  | 3V3          |
| 2         | GND   | Ground      | P01-20  | GND          |
| 3         | D0    | Clock       | P01-23  | GPIO 11      |
| 4         | D1    | MOSI        | P01-19  | GPIO 10      |
| 5         | RST   | Reset       | P01-22  | GPIO 25      |
| 6         | DC    | Data/Command| P01-18  | GPIO 24      |
| 7         | CS    | Chip Select | P01-24  | GPIO 8 (CE0) |

Notes:

* When using the 4-wire SPI connection, Data/Command is an "out of band" signal
  that tells the controller if you're sending commands or display data. This
  line is not a part of SPI and the library controls it with a separate GPIO
  pin. With 3-wire SPI and I2C, the Data/Command signal is sent "in band".
  
* If you're already using the listed GPIO pins for Data/Command and/or Reset,
  you can select other pins and pass a `gpio_command_data_select` and/or a
  `gpio_reset` argument specifying the new pin numbers in your serial interface
  create call.
  
* The use of the terms 4-wire and 3-wire SPI are a bit confusing because, in
  most SPI documentation, the terms are used to describe the regular 4-wire
  configuration of SPI and a 3-wire mode where the input and ouput lines, MOSI
  and MISO, have been combined into a single line called SISO. However, in the
  context of these OLED controllers, 4-wire means MOSI + Data/Command and 3-wire
  means Data/Command sent as an extra bit over MOSI.
  
* Because CS is connected to CE0, the display is available on SPI port 0. You
  can connect it to CE1 to have it available on port 1. If so, pass `port=1` in
  your serial interface create call.

* The Reset connection is not strictly necessary. It's useful if the display
  gets into an undefined state. Without Reset connected, you'll have to
  disconnect and reconnect the Raspberry Pi power if it becomes necessary to
  reset the display.

### Setup

Enable the SPI port:

    $ sudo raspi-config
    > Advanced Options > A6 SPI

If raspi-config is not available, this can be done manually. Search the web.

# Installing the display driver

Install general dependencies:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip libfreetype6-dev pillow
    $ sudo pip install wiringpi2

The ssd1306 package is installed directly from GitHub:

    $ sudo apt-get install git

Copy the HTTPS clone URL from the right sidebar on this page.

    $ git clone <HTTPS clone URL>
    $ cd ssd1306
    $ sudo python setup.py install

This will install the python files in `/usr/local/lib/python2.7` making them
ready for use in other programs.

# Using the display driver

Driving the display from Python is very simple, expecially if you have ever used
[Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) or PIL. The performance is
also acceptable, at 12 FPS when drawing 10 filled circles and printing a line of
text in each frame (see the bounce.py example).

First, import the library and PIL:

```python
import oled.device
import oled.render

from PIL import ImageFont, ImageDraw
```

Select serial interface to match your OLED device. The defaults for the
arguments are shown. No arguments are required.

For I2C:
```python
serial_interface = oled.device.I2C(port=1, address=0x3C, cmd_mode=0x00, data_mode=0x40)
```

For SPI:
```python
serial_interface = oled.device.SPI(port=0, spi_bus_speed_hz=32000000, gpio_command_data_select=24, gpio_reset=25)
```

Then select the controller chip to match your OLED device.

For SH1106:
```python
device = oled.device.sh1106(serial_interface)
```

For SSD1306:
```python
device = oled.device.ssd1306(serial_interface)
```

The display device should now be configured, initialized and ready for use. The
device classes expose a `display()` method which takes a 1-bit depth image.
However, for most cases, for drawing text and graphics primitives, the canvas
class should be used as follows:

```python
font = ImageFont.load_default()
with oled.render.canvas(device) as draw:
    draw.rectangle((0, 0, device.width, device.height), outline=0, fill=0)
    draw.text(30, 40, "Hello World", font=font, fill=255)
```

The `canvas` class automatically creates an
[ImageDraw](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/ImageDraw.html)
object of the correct dimensions and bit depth suitable for the device, so you
may then call the usual Pillow methods to draw onto the canvas.

As soon as the with scope is ended, the resultant image is automatically flushed
to the device's display memory and the ImageDraw object is garbage collected.

## Examples
    
After installing the library, enter the `examples` directory and edit the
examples to select your serial interface and controller chip type and
parameters, then run them.

| Example          | Description                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| draw_commands.py | Use misc draw commands to create a simple image          |
| bounce.py        | Display a bouncing ball animation and frames per second  |
| sys_info.py      | Display system information (as shown in the image above) |
| pi_logo.py       | Display the Raspberry Pi logo (loads image as .png)      |
| maze.py          | Display a maze                                           |
